This is a real time graphical chatroom that uses a database to authenticate users.

In order to set everything up, you must first run the server, which is connected to a MySQL database. 
Make sure you adjust the database IP address (as well as the login credentials) if your database is not locally accessible.

Then, you may create as many "ClientUI" instances as you would like.
